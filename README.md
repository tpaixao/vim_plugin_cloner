# VIM repo cloner

A simple utility to help me setup my vim setup whenever I install it on a new machine.

 * __getting a list of repos__: _get_repos.sh_ will list all your repos
 * __updating your repos__:  _pull_repos.sh_ will update all your plugins. The argument is the bundle directory.
 * __reinstalling all your repos__: clones the repos listed in a file (which it takes as an argument).
